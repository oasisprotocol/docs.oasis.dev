# Delegation Policy

Oasis Protocol Foundation (OPF) delegates ROSE tokens to node operators based on
their participation in the Oasis Mainnet, Testnet and ParaTimes on the network,
node reliability and performance, community engagement and overall support of
the network.

:::info

Starting in the first quarter of 2024, OPF will initiate the Know Your Customer
(KYC) process for all validators receiving delegation from OPF. It is essential
for node operators to ensure that you have access to the email address provided
in yours metadata submissions. This step is crucial for completing the KYC
procedure efficiently. Please update your contact details if necessary.
