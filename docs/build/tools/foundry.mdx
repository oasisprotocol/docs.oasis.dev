# Foundry

[Foundry] is a smart contract development environment 
for EVM-based chains. This guide will show you how to use Foundry to build, 
test, and deploy smart contracts on Oasis Sapphire.


:::info

For comprehensive details about Foundry's features, consult the
[Foundry documentation].

:::

Foundry contains the following tools:

- **Forge** is a CLI [tool] for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts. 
Due to integrated revm it significantly increases runtime speed when testing. 

- **Anvil** is a local development EVM [node]. 
It is installed as part of Foundry, but currently does not work with Sapphire.

- **Cast** is a [CLI tool] for interacting with EVM nodes. As it uses RPC calls it can be used
to interact with Sapphire localnet/testnet nodes.

- **Chisel** is Solidity [REPL]. Not tested with Sapphire contracts, so use at your own risk.


## Setup and Configuration

Foundry uses default revm EVM implementation which does not contain 
all [Sapphire-specific features].
For that reason, we have to install special Sapphire precompiles which are 
available in the Sapphire foundry integration package. 
Steps 3-7 are required only for running tests with Forge.

1. Install and run Foundryup:
   ```shell
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Create a new Forge project and move inside:
   ```shell
   forge init sapphire_demo
   cd sapphire_demo
   ```
3. After initializing the project, you should have a `foundry.toml` 
file in the root of your project. Copy the following content to it:
```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib", "dependencies"]
ffi = true

[dependencies]
"@oasisprotocol-sapphire-contracts" = "0.2.11"
"@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry" = "0.1.0"
```
   - `ffi = true` enables `vm.ffi()` ([foreign function interface]) which is used to call rust bindings 
   which contain the precompile and decryption logic.
   - `"dependencies"` is a list of dependencies that are required for the project.
   We use Foundry package manager [soldeer] to install these dependencies.
4. Install dependencies with soldeer:
   ```shell
   forge soldeer install
   ```
5. Install rust nightly:
   ```shell
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup toolchain install nightly
   rustup default nightly
   ```
6. Install Sapphire precompiles:
   ```shell
   cd dependencies/@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry-0.1.0/precompiles
   cargo +nightly build --release
   ```
7. Enable ffi (foreign function interface) in foundry.toml:
   ```shell
   ffi = true
   ```

## Sapphire specific features

Users who aren't familiar with confidential benefits of Sapphire 
should take a moment to review the Ethereum [comparison page].
The `@oasisprotocol-sapphire-foundry` package enables 
testing with precompiles and encrypted calls.

#### Precompiles

Sapphire precompiles are special precompiled contracts that 
contain cryptographic primitives and enable confidential transactions.
Since Foundry uses un-customized revm, they are not available by default.

To enable them in Forge tests, add the **import** statement to your test file:

```solidity
import {SapphireTest} from "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-contracts-0.2.11/BaseSapphireTest.sol";
```
and then inherit from `SapphireTest` from `BaseSapphireTest.sol` 
and override the `setUp()` function:
```solidity
   contract PrecompileTest is SapphireTest {
      
      function setUp() public override {
         super.setUp();
      }
```

#### Encrypted Transactions and Calls

Sapphire uses end-to-end encryption for confidential transactions and calls.
This means that the calldata is encrypted using the shared [key].
For non-encrypted transactions, the process works same as on Ethereum.
However, when testing for example [gasless transactions] with Foundry,
we need to add a few things.

After deploying the precompiles in the previous step, we need to 
update our custom contract, encrypt the transaction and broadcast it.

1. `SapphireDecryptor` is a special contract that implements decryption through the fallback function.
We need to inherit from it to enable decryption.
```solidity
   import {SapphireDecryptor} from "@oasisprotocol-sapphire-contracts-0.2.11/BinaryContracts.sol";

   contract CustomContract is SapphireDecryptor {
```
2. See [examples/foundry] for this step to see 
how to test encrypted gasless transaction.
3. `vm.broadcastRawTransaction(raw_tx)` to send the raw transaction.


### Forge Tests

To run tests add a new file in the `tests/` directory. Run tests with:
```shell
forge test
```

example.

### Forge Script

To run a script add a new file in the `scripts/` directory. Run scripts with: 
```shell
forge script
```
Forge scripts should run the same way as tests.

# A note on Forks/External RPC nodes

When running scripts, we might also want to run on Localnet/Testnet/Mainnet 
using `--rpc-url` or `--fork-url`.
This is not possible with this setup, because Sapphire precompiles are not 
available in the default revm.
When using forge script on a external RPC node or a fork, 
precompiles are available through `vm.rpcUrl()` cheatcode.
To disable simulation on integrated revm make sure to disable 
simulation with `--no-simulation` flag and 
remove the imports and inheritances from previous steps.

# Verification with Foundry

After contracts are deployed, you can verify them with Sourcify. 
Check out the [verification with foundry] section for more details.
